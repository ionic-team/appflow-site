Today, we’re thrilled to announce Web Previews in Appflow, the easiest way to share what you’re working on with coworkers, stakeholders, and more. 

Web Previews represent the next step in our belief in the [web first development strategy](https://ionicframework.com/blog/forget-mobile-first-progressive-web-app-first-is-the-future/), and we’re especially excited for what this feature enables for teams who want a quick and easy way to share pre-production versions of their app, without the overhead and complexity of managing TestFlight, iOS enterprise certs, or any of the more complicated methods of showing off what you’ve built.

The entire update is covered [on the Ionic blog](https://ionicframework.com/blog/announcing-web-previews-in-appflow/). You can also view a short overview video to see Web Previews in action:
